# TOWAN Project (The One Without A Name)

UPDATE: I am keeping this project but will remove the django admin extension and it will be replace by a towan-client desktop
application.

Also there is a demo available [here](http://lola.ninja). You can donate to the project via this interface.

### Presentation

Little raspberry pi project that allow a user to transform a complicate bitcoin address in a human readable URL.

### Explication

TOWAN offers an endpoint that sends a new bitcoin address everytime it is called (HD). It also offers a little interface for the owner.

### TODO ##

* Slackbot !
* ~~Check if one of the last 20 addresses there is a transaction.~~ (Use Blocktrail will offer other solution later)
* Use SPV wallet instead of Blocktrail
* Docs
* Tests

### Contribute

You will need Vagrant installed.

Start Vagrant :
```
$ vagrant up
```

### Notes ##

#### Generate Public Testnet Master Key

You can use [Copay](https://copay.io/). It allows Testnet wallet and you can get the Public Master key.

Once you have it, you can change it in address/models.py (Need to create a script to ask it automatically the first time).

#### The .env file

The `.env` file contain all the environement variable needed and that you don't want to put in the `settings.py`.

Take the `_.env` rename it in `.env` and replace the dummy key with your own.

#### Start docker

```
$ docker build -t towan .
$ docker run --name towan -p 80:8000 -d towan
```
